title: Sentiment Analysis in Ruby

I'll be giving a speech on “Sentiment Analysis in Ruby” at the Pittsburgh Ruby Brigade's monthly meeting.  I will be giving the speech with the assumption that the audience understands programming, but doesn't know anything about machine learning or its uses. Machine learning is kind of in the background of all of our lives – e.g., spam filters, Netflix and Amazon recommendations, voice recognition – but like most things in life today, there's not really time in people's lives to get an in-depth understanding.  I'm hoping to get people to at least understand the basic concept.

Assuming that I can fit everything into the half-hour allocated for my speech, here is what I want to go over.  Suggestions are more than welcome!

1. _Basics of Machine Learning_ – The Very Concept, Supervised vs Unsupervised, Natural Language Processing
2. _Sentiment Analysis_ – What Is It?  What Is It Used For?  Why?
3. _Developing a Sentiment Analysis Engine_ – Bag of Words Model, Parsing, Bayesian Analysis, Objectivity vs Subjectivity
4. _Training Your Engine_ – Historical Data Sets, Gathering Recent Data, Categorizing Results
5. _Example_ – A fully-functioning Rails app on a test data set
