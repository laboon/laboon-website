		<div class="entry"><p>While the Ruby culture seems to really celebrate dynamic testing, there is less emphasis on static analysis tools.  While there are certainly good examples of static analysis tools for Ruby such as flog, they're just not as popular as statically-typed languages like Java.  Now part of this is because doing static analysis on a dynamic language is much more difficult.  However, that's no reason not to try!  With that in mind, I have put together two small scripts for helping with static analysis of your Ruby code.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, 8 December 2012, I (along with over 3,500 other software developers) took part in the 2012 Global Day of Code Retreat.  This was my first code retreat, and going into it, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I googled and asked some of my friends who had been to previous ones, but it still seemed pretty mysterious to me.  A bunch of people sit around programming Conway's Game of Life, but with different restrictions?  Sounds intriguing, but I still wasn't sure what would actually happen.  I told myself I'd write up a blog post with a blow-by-blow the next day to help other people who were deciding whether or not to sign up.  Spoiler alert: this was one of most fun and helpful days I have had as a programmer, and I have been programming for a long time.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I was attempting to solve Problem 12 of Project Euler – “What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?”  I came up with a relatively simple solution, which was not at all optimized, although it seemed to be functionally correct.  However, time to execute was taking ridiculously long – almost a minute for > 100 divisors, and I gave up after waiting 10 minutes for 500 divisors.  Execution time looked to be growing exponentially – I didn't run any real tests to determine its actual big-O, but it was definitely superlinear.  I realized my brute force algorithm was almost certainly the cause of this ugly performance.  However, performance testing in a purely functional language is difficult – I couldn't just add some debug print statements like I would in a traditional imperative language.  Therefore, I had to use a profiler to see what was going on internally.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>One of the things that I've noticed about functional programming, and Haskell in particular, is that it really makes you think about the problem in order to get a good solution.  Programming in general is often punctuated with long stretches of what seem to be wasted brain cycles with brief flashes of inspiration.  Functional programming seems to be this to the nth power, but those brief flashes lead to incredibly elegant code.  Those brief flashes are also becoming more and more regular as I get used to the functional way of thinking.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>A few of us on the Pittsburgh Learn You a Haskell group are going through the Project Euler problem set in Haskell.  Franklin's been kind enough to set up a template for this in a more official capacity (with a test harness, making it executable, etc.), but for my first problem, I was more interested in the paradigm itself.  This really showed the power of doing things through the REPL, and once I had the solution figured out, I could pretty it up and move it into functions.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I'll be giving a speech on “Sentiment Analysis in Ruby” at the Pittsburgh Ruby Brigade's monthly meeting.  I will be giving the speech with the assumption that the audience understands programming, but doesn't know anything about machine learning or its uses. Machine learning is kind of in the background of all of our lives – e.g., spam filters, Netflix and Amazon recommendations, voice recognition – but like most things in life today, there's not really time in people's lives to get an in-depth understanding.  I'm hoping to get people to at least understand the basic concept.</p>
